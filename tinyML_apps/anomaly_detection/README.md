## Links to Continue Learning about Autoencoders

If you would like to learn more about anomaly detection with autoencoders, check out this excellent [interactive example](https://anomagram.fastforwardlabs.com/#/) built with TensorFlow.js by Victor Dibia. For a real-world use case, you can learn how [Airbus Detects Anomalies in ISS Telemetry Data](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/04/how-airbus-detects-anomalies-iss-telemetry-data-tfx.html) using TensorFlow. 

To learn more about the basics of autoencoders, try the basis for this colab, [TensorFlow's Intro to Autoencoders](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/autoencoder.ipynb#scrollTo=xfNT-mlFwxVM)

For more info, consider reading this [blog post](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html) by Fran√ßois Chollet, and check out chapter 14 from [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
